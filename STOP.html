<h3>Info</h3>
<div id="InfoBox">

    The destruction of open green spaces remains a major problem in EVERYONE'S daily lives. Even
    if you truly couldn't care less about natural parks being urbanized, or trees being cut down,
    nature offers many benefits to humans that we simply take for granted everyday.
    UK studies show that exposure to nature can reduce hypertension, respiratory tract and cardiovascular illnesses;
    improve vitality and mood; benefit issues of mental well being such as anxiety; and restore attention capacity and mental fatigue.
    But more than that, feeling a part of nature has been shown to significantly correlate with life satisfaction, vitality, meaningfulness,
    happiness, mindfulness, and lower cognitive anxiety. SO, why not help stop this abomination that is the destruction of open green spaces.
